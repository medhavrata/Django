# Django
This repo is to build a Djano app

1. Install Django
  - pip3 install django

2. Next, start a new project
  - django-admin startproject password_generator

3. Go to password_generator directory and run: python3 manage.py runserver, and it will run the default server
4. When we execute the 'django-admin startproject password_generator' command, django will create a directory with name password_generator. Inside this, there will be another directory named password_generator(having more files inside), a file manage.py, another file db.sqlite3
5. We can rename the top level directory to password_generator_project so that we know this is the top level project
6. Django project is the complete website and inside this website we can have many Applications, which represent a separte functionality of the website.
7. run the command 'python3 manage.py startapp generator' to create an application inside the project
